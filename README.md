## BB84 Quantum Key Distribution Simulation
Python implementation of the BB84 protocol, developed as part of my bachelor thesis in Physics.

Key features:
- One-by-one qubit transmission through a noisy quantum channel
- Optional intercept–resend eavesdropping
- Basis reconciliation and error estimation
- Multiple error-correction methods (XOR, ECC16, ECC32, Hamming(7,4), Cascade)
- Privacy amplification
- One-time-pad message encryption
- Statistical analysis and visualisation of protocol performance

Everything is implemented from scratch using a clean, modular class structure.

## Bachelor Thesis  
**Numerical Simulation of Quantum Key Distribution Using the BB84 Protocol**  
Stockholm University, Department of Physics

Covers the quantum mechanics needed for BB84, walks through the protocol step by step, describes the structure of the simulation code,
and presents clear statistical analyses of how BB84 performs under different noise levels and error-correction schemes.
